# Reinforcement Learning Practice #

This is a small Python package for practicing the implementation of
reinforcement learning algorithms.  This should not be used for anything
remotely compute-intensive, mostly messing around with OpenAI Gym.

## Requirements ##

* NumPy
* OpenAI Gym
* pytest (for testing)

## Installation ##

`python ./setup.py install`
